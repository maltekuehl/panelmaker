## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](/docs/community/conduct). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where diverse perspectives strengthen our collective impact on biomedical research.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Search existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
- Use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
- Provide detailed reproduction steps, environment details, and screenshots if applicable
- Include relevant error messages and console output

### Suggesting Features

- **Check the [roadmap](/docs/community/roadmap)** to see if it's already planned
- Open a GitHub issue with a clear description of the feature
- Explain the use case and why it would benefit the community
- Be open to discussion and feedback from maintainers

### Security Vulnerabilities

- **Do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues**
- Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
- See our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for detailed reporting instructions

### Submitting MCP Servers to the Registry

- Follow the [Registry Contributing Guide](/docs/registry/contributing)
- Ensure your MCP server meets metadata and licensing requirements
- MCP servers should be open source and free for academic use

### Contributing Code

We welcome code contributions including:

- Bug fixes
- Feature implementations
- Performance improvements
- Documentation improvements
- Test additions
- UI/UX enhancements

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Use the version specified in `.nvmrc` (use `nvm use` to switch)
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js
- **PostgreSQL**: A Postgres database for development
- **Git**: For version control

### Setup Instructions

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/website.git
cd website
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
nvm use  # Use the correct Node.js version
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and add your configuration:

- Database connection (`DATABASE_URL`, `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL`)
- Authentication providers (GitHub, LinkedIn OAuth credentials)
- API keys (Gemini, GitHub token)
- Other required secrets

4. **Set up the database:**

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

**Note:** Prisma migrations should always be created with `--create-only` and cannot be applied directly in this project.

5. **Start the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your local instance.

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Create a feature branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation
- `refactor/` for code refactoring
- `test/` for test additions

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the [code guidelines](#code-guidelines) below
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Comment complex logic
- Update documentation if needed
- Add tests for new functionality

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run tests (requires test database)
npm run test

# Run tests in UI mode
npm run test:ui
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user profile page"
# or
git commit -m "fix: resolve authentication redirect issue"
```

Follow conventional commit format:
- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `style:` formatting changes
- `refactor:` code refactoring
- `test:` test additions/changes
- `chore:` maintenance tasks

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub using the [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md).

## Code Guidelines

### Technology Stack

This project uses:
- **React** with **Next.js 15** (App Router)
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Prisma** for database ORM
- **shadcn/ui** + **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Auth.js (NextAuth.js v5)** for authentication
- **Playwright** for E2E testing

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new code
- **ESLint**: Follow the project's ESLint configuration
- **Prettier**: Code is automatically formatted (configured in `.prettierrc.json`)
- **Naming**: Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components
- **Components**: Use functional components with hooks

### Best Practices

1. **Clean Code**: Focus on maintainable, readable code
2. **Performance**: Consider performance and scalability implications
3. **Security**: 
   - Never hardcode secrets or API keys
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Sanitize user inputs
   - Follow security guidelines in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure UI components are accessible
5. **Responsive Design**: Test on multiple screen sizes
6. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and user feedback

### UI/UX Guidelines

- Use **shadcn/ui** components for consistency
- Follow **Tailwind CSS** design patterns
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use semantic HTML elements

### Database Changes

When making database changes:

1. Create migrations with `npx prisma migrate dev --create-only --name descriptive_name`
2. Review the generated migration files
3. Test migrations on development database
4. Include migration files in your PR
5. Document breaking changes

### API Routes

- Use Zod for request validation
- Implement proper error handling
- Apply rate limiting where appropriate
- Require authentication for sensitive endpoints
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Follow REST principles

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests in headed mode
npm run test:headed

# Debug tests
npm run test:debug
```

### Writing Tests

- Write **Playwright** tests for E2E functionality
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Test critical user flows and API endpoints
- Include both happy path and error scenarios
- Use descriptive test names

Example test structure:

```typescript
test('should display user profile after login', async ({ page }) => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### Test Coverage

For larger features, implement Playwright tests once everything works. Focus on:

- Authentication flows
- Critical user actions
- API endpoint behavior
- Error states
- Edge cases

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Fill out the PR template** completely
2. **Link related issues** using `Fixes #123` or `Closes #456`
3. **Provide clear description** of what changes and why
4. **Include screenshots/videos** for UI changes
5. **Check all boxes** in the PR checklist
6. **Ensure tests pass** before submitting
7. **Keep PRs focused** - one feature/fix per PR
8. **Be responsive** to review feedback

### Review Process

- A maintainer will review your PR
- Address any feedback or requested changes
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR
