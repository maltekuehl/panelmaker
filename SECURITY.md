## Security Measures

### Application Security

PanelMaker implements several security measures:

- **Authentication**: Secure authentication using Auth.js (NextAuth.js) v5
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for admin and user features
- **Database Security**: Prisma ORM with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation for all user inputs
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in CSRF protection with Auth.js
- **Session Security**: Secure session management with HTTP-only cookies
- **Content Security**: Sanitized HTML rendering with sanitize-html
- **HTTPS**: Enforced HTTPS in production environments

### Data Protection

- **Biomedical Data**: Special consideration for sensitive biomedical research data
- **User Privacy**: Minimal data collection with clear privacy policies
- **Data Encryption**: Encryption in transit and at rest for sensitive data
- **Access Logging**: Comprehensive logging of data access and modifications

### MCP Server Security

- **Server Validation**: Validation of MCP server metadata and functionality
- **Sandboxed Execution**: MCP servers run in controlled environments
- **Connection Security**: Secure communication protocols for MCP connections
- **Registry Verification**: Manual review process for new MCP servers

### Infrastructure Security

- **Dependency Management**: Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate environments for development, testing, and production
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of API keys and sensitive configuration
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for suspicious activities

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to PanelMaker, please follow these security guidelines:

### Code Security

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use Prisma ORM's built-in protections
- **XSS Prevention**: Properly escape output and use React's built-in protections
- **Authentication Checks**: Verify user authentication and authorization for protected routes
- **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages

### Dependencies

- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated to their latest secure versions
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Run `npm audit` before submitting PRs
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only add dependencies that are absolutely necessary
- **License Compliance**: Ensure all dependencies have compatible licenses

### Environment Variables

- **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets or API keys to the repository
- **Environment Separation**: Use different secrets for different environments
- **Access Control**: Limit access to production environment variables

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limiting for API endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Validate all API inputs using Zod schemas
- **Error Responses**: Return generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- **Authentication**: Require authentication for all sensitive API endpoints

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: Our team will investigate and validate the reported vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We will develop and test a fix for confirmed vulnerabilities
4. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate responsible disclosure with the reporter
5. **Deployment**: Security fixes will be deployed as soon as possible
6. **Communication**: We will communicate with affected users as appropriate

## Security Updates

- Security updates are released as soon as fixes are available
